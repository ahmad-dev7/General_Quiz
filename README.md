This is a quiz app built using Flutter that allows users to answer a series of true or false questions. The app utilizes the Google Fonts and Audiofileplayer packages to add custom fonts and sound effects to the app. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed along with the option to restart the quiz. The quiz is randomly shuffled each time the quiz is restarted. The app has been designed with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
